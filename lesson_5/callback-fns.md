# Working with Callback Functions

## The Concept of first-class values/objects

In most programming languages, the term first-class value or first-class object is used to describe values that meet the following conditions:

- They can be assigned to a variable or an element of a data structure (such as an array or object)
- They can be passed as an argument to a function
- They can be returned as the return value of a function

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ In JavaScript, functions meet this criteria. That is why it is said that JS functions are first-class citizens, or first-class functions.

## Higher Order Functions

Functions that take other functions as arguments are called Higher Order Functions.

Let's take a look at some examples of methods that take callbacks and analyze each component in depth:

### Example 1

Take a moment to digest this example:

```js
[
  [1, 2],
  [3, 4],
].forEach((arr) => console.log(arr[0]));
// 1
// 3
// => undefined
```

What's happening in this seemingly-simple piece of code? Take it apart and try to describe every interaction with precision.

#### Solution

`Array.prototype.forEach` is being called on a multidimensional array containing two sub-arrays, each sub-array contains two positive integers. At each iteration, we assign the value of the current array to the parameter `arr` and using the callback `arr => console.log(arr[0])` we get the value at index 0 (the first element, `arr[0]`) of the current array using the reference operator `[]`, disregarding any subsequent elements from that array. This prints `1`, `3`, and then returns `undefined` as expected from any call to `forEach`.

### Example 2

```js
[
  [1, 2],
  [3, 4],
].map((arr) => console.log(arr[0]));
// 1
// 3
// => [undefined, undefined]
```

### Solution

| Action                      | Performed on                          | Side Effect                               | Return Value                         | Is Return Value Used?                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| method call (`map`)         | outer array                           | None                                      | New array (`[undefined, undefined]`) | No, but shown on line 4                  |
| callback execution          | Each sub-array                        | None                                      | `undefined`                          | Yes, used by `map` for transformation    |
| element reference (`[0]`)   | Each sub-array                        | None                                      | Element at index 0 of sub-array      | Yes, used by `console.log`               |
| method call (`console.log`) | Element at index `0` of the sub-array | Outputs string representation of a Number | `undefined`                          | Yes, used as the callback's return value |

Starting with a multidimensional array which contains two arrays that each contain two integers, we pass the top-level array to `Array.prototype.map`. At each iteration, we're passing each array to the callbackFn to `map` with the argument name `arr` and returning the result of calling `console.log` on the first element in the current array which we get with `arr[0]`. This prints the first element of `arr` to the console, but the return value of `console.log` is always `undefined` and since that's what we're getting returned from the callback to `map` we're building a new array which contains two `undefined` values. It contains two and not four because we're only going through the first value of each sub-array, the array being mapped is the top-level array and not the nested ones.

### Example 3

```js
[
  [1, 2],
  [3, 4],
].map((arr) => {
  console.log(arr[0]);
  return arr[0];
});
```

```js
let myArr = [
  [18, 7],
  [3, 12],
].forEach((arr) => {
  return arr.map((num) => {
    if (num > 5) {
      return console.log(num);
    }
  });
});
