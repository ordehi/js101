# Selection and Transformation

**Selection** is picking some elements out of a collection depending on one or more criteria. For example, you might want to pick out all the odd numbers from an array.

**Transformation**, on the other hand, refers to manipulating every element in the collection. For example, increment all elements of an array by 1.

If there areÂ *N* elements in a collection, selection results inÂ *N* or fewer elements, while transformation always results in the same number,Â *N*, of elements.

Both use the basics of looping; a loop, a counter, a way to get the current value, and a way to exit out of the loop. They also use criteria; to determine which element to select, or the transformation to apply.

Conditionals are common in selection since the criteria often requires selecting elements that meet some characteristics, while transformation doesnâ€™t often require conditionals as it applies to the entire collection.

ðŸ’¡ When performing a transformation, it's always important to pay attention to whether the original collection is mutated or if a new collection is returned.

## Extracting to Functions - Selection

Selection and transformation often lend themselves to extraction into convenience functions given the specificity of the actions performed each time.

How would you extract selecting the key-value pairs of a function where the value is `'Fruit'`.

### Attempted Solution

#### Problem Understanding

Given a collection of key-value pairs, return a new collection with the key-value pairs that have the value 'Fruit'.

**Explicit Requirements**

- Select all values equal to 'Fruit'
- Iterate through all key-value pairs of input

**Implicit Requirements**

- Need a conditional check to match against 'Fruit'
- Need an intermediate object to return at the end

**Clarifying Questions**

- Should the match against 'Fruit' be case-sensitive? No
- Should I return a new object? Yes
- What to do with invalid input? Return empty object

#### Examples and Test Cases

```js
let produce = {
  apple: 'Fruit',
  carrot: 'Vegetable',
  pear: 'Fruit',
  broccoli: 'Vegetable',
};

selectFruit(produce); // => { apple: 'Fruit', pear: 'Fruit' }
```

#### Data Structure

- An intermetidate object literal to hold the key-value pairs that match the selection
- A loop iterates through the values of input and adds the matching values to the intermetidate object

**Considering iteration**

We could use `for...in` to iterate object properties.

With `for...in` you use a conditional to check if `object[currentItem]` matches the selection, and add that to result if it does.

```js
for (let item in produce) {
  if (produce[item] == 'Fruit') {
    result[item] = produce[item];
  }
}
```

We could use `Object.entries()` to create an array of sub-arrays that are the key-value pairs of input, and build the output object from that array using something such as `Array.includes()`.

#### Algorithm

START

-# Given a collection of key-value pairs called produce

SET a variable "result" and initialize it to an empty collection

SET a variable "item" and initialize it to the first property name of "produce"

WHILE there are unread properties in "produce"

- if the value of property "item" in "produce" equals 'Fruit' add "item": "value" to "result"

RETURN result

END

## Extracting to Functions - Transformation

The following function doubles each element in an array (elmenet \* 2) doesn't mutate its argument:

```js
function doubleNumbers(numbers) {
  let doubledNums = [];
  let counter = 0;

  while (counter < numbers.length) {
    let currentNum = numbers[counter];
    doubledNums.push(currentNum * 2);

    counter += 1;
  }

  return doubledNums;
}
```

Can you implement it so that it mutates its argument?

### Attempted Solution

```js
function doubleNumbers(numbers) {
  let counter = 0;

  while (counter < numbers.length) {
    numbers[counter] *= 2;
    counter += 1;
  }

  return numbers;
}
```

When a transformation only transforms a subset of elements in a collection, it is sometimes called an **identity transformation**. Why not just call it a selective transformation? I'd think most people that hear both terms would think of a variant of combining the words "selection" and "transformation"

### Exercise

Reimplement this function:

```js
function doubleOddNumbers(numbers) {
  let doubledNums = [];

  for (let counter = 0; counter < numbers.length; counter += 1) {
    let currentNumber = numbers[counter];

    if (currentNumber % 2 === 1) {
      doubledNums.push(currentNumber * 2);
    } else {
      doubledNums.push(currentNumber);
    }
  }

  return doubledNums;
}
```

So that it doubles the numbers that have odd indices.

```js
function isOdd(integer) {
  return integer % 2 === 1;
}

function doubleOddIndices(integerArray) {
  return integerArray.map((integer, currIndex) =>
    isOdd(currIndex) ? (integer *= 2) : integer
  );
}
```
